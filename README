What it is
==========

The Revised OpenFlow Library (ROFL) helps you adding OpenFlow support to your software to build control applications, controller frameworks and/or datapath elements.

ROFL-datapath contains an OpenFlow pipeline (v1.0, 1.2 and 1.3) and a Hardware Abstraction Layer(HAL) libraries for building datapaths, written in C.

Requirements
============

- A modern GNU build-system (autoconf, automake, libtool, ...)
- pkg-config
- GNU/Linux and libc development headers (linux-libc-dev and libc6-dev package in Debian/Ubuntu systems)
- [optional] if you want to run automatic tests (make check), libcunit and libcppunit are required (in libcunit1-dev and libcppunit-dev packages in Debian-like systems).
- [optional] Doxygen to generate the documentation.

How to build
============

Install the dependencies and run:

	sh# ./autogen.sh  
	sh# cd build  
	sh# ../configure  
	sh# make  
	sh# make install  

Optionally you can 'make check' for consistency checks.

Optional ../configure parameters
================================

	--enable-debug: compile with debug symbols (-g) and debug output (warning, it may affect performance)  
	--enable-verbose: increase the level of debug (useless without --enable-debug)  
	--disable-silent-rules: enable verbose compilation mode (AM_SILENT_RULES disabled)
        
	--with-pipeline-lockess: use lockless pipeline (packet processing API)
	--with-pipeline-platform-funcs-inlined: inline platform functions (packet processing API)
	

Doxygen documentation
================================
Documentation can be compiled via `make doc`. Documentation is generated in build/doc/ folder

Known issues
================================

* Certain GCC 4.8.X family versions are buggy and don't properly compile ROFL with -O3 optimizations. Please use GCC 4.8.3 or higher, or another version family.

FAQ
===

Some distributions, in particular Red Hat based, do not include by default /usr/local/lib on the search path of ldconfig, not allowing to link against -lrofl and -lrofl_pipeline. In this case, you might have to add /usr/local/lib/ into /etc/ld.so.conf and re-run ldconfig.
