* This call may only be used if the platform does not have a hardware
* accelerated packet matching machinery. Packet matches of the datapacket_t MUST be initialized
* before calling of_process_packet_pipeline()
*
* The tid is a unique ID between 0 (ROFL_PIPELINE_LOCKED_TID) and ROFL_PIPELINE_MAX_PIPELINE_TIDS-1
* which is used to process packets lockless. It is up to the rofl-pipeline user to prevent two threads
* (or processes/bare metal CPUs sharing memory) to use the same TID.
*
* The special ROFL_PIPELINE_LOCKED_TID is a special ID, which allow at the expense of memory barriers and
* locking.
* 
* @param tid Thread ID. 
* @param sw The switch which has to process the packet 
* @param pkt A struct datapacket instance. All the fields must be set to NULL
* except maybe platform_state 
* @warning Packet matches of the datapacket_t MUST be initialized before calling of_process_packet_pipeline()
